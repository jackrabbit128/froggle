= Froggle

A simple Boggle-like word-finding game to play with my friends.
It allows controlling the random seed so that remote players can sync up.

The idea is that all players install the application locally and use it together with a (video-)chat application.
By not having any networking, rule-checking or points-counting, players are made to act as in real-life play.
This way, the social aspect of the game is preserved.

To play together, everyone fills in the same random seed and press the play button at the same time.
Everyone then gets the same board and the same amount of time to look for words.
When the time is elapsed, everyone reads out the words they found.
If you are the only one that found that word, you get points.
The amount of points you win for a word of length _n_ is _n_ - 2, with a minimum of 0.
It is only useful to find words of at least length 3.
The player who scores the most points (in a pre-agreed number of rounds) is the winner.
